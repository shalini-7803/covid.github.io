                <h1>SYMPTOMS</h1>
                <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
                </p>
                <ul>Most common symtoms:</ul>
                <li>fever</li>
                <li>dry cough</li>
                <li>tiredness</li>

                <br>

                <ul>Less common symptoms:</ul>
                <li>aches and pains</li>
                <li>sore throat</li>
                <li>diarrhoea</li>
                <li>conjunctivitis</li>
                <li>headache</li>
                <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
                <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>

                <br>

                <ul>Serious symptoms:</ul>
                <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
                <li>chest pain or pressure</li>
                <li>loss of speech or movement</li>
               <br>

               <p>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.<br>
                People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.<br>
                On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.</p>
                <p>People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical care immediately. If possible, call your health care provider, hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic.</p>
                <p>COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.</p>
                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</p>
                <h2> HOW IT SPREADS</h2>
                <P>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
                You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.<br>Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions or their respiratory droplets, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings.Although the risk of transmission after symptom resolution is likely to be minimal based on what is currently known, it cannot be completely ruled out.<br>
                The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).</P>
                <p> risk of catching the COVID-19 virus from the faeces of an infected person appears to be low.

                There is some evidence that the COVID-19 virus may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces. Approximately 2−10% of cases of confirmed COVID-19 disease presented with diarrhoea (2−4), and two studies detected COVID-19 viral RNA fragments in the faecal matter of COVID-19 patients (5,6).<br>
                
                However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen (7). There have been no reports of faecal−oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
