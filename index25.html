                <h1>SYMPTOMS</h1>
                <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
                </p>
                <ul>Most common symtoms:</ul>
                <li>fever</li>
                <li>dry cough</li>
                <li>tiredness</li>

                <br>

                <ul>Less common symptoms:</ul>
                <li>aches and pains</li>
                <li>sore throat</li>
                <li>diarrhoea</li>
                <li>conjunctivitis</li>
                <li>headache</li>
                <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
                <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>

                <br>

                <ul>Serious symptoms:</ul>
                <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
                <li>chest pain or pressure</li>
                <li>loss of speech or movement</li>
               <br>

               <p>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.<br>
                People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.<br>
                On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.</p>
                <!--<p>People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical care immediately. If possible, call your health care provider, hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic.</p>
                <p>COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.</p>
                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</p>
                <h2> HOW IT SPREADS</h2>
                <P>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
                You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>-->

                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                    Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.<br>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br>An early Chinese study of 103 COVID-19 cases found two strains, which they named L and S. The S type is older, but the L type was more common in early stages of the outbreak. They think one may cause more cases of the disease than the other, but they’re still working on what it all means. 
                    It is also normal for a virus to change, or mutate, as it infects people and this virus has done so. There are several variants which have been named for the regions they were first discovered but they have now spread to other areas and countries. </p>
